This was done to get a better sense of if and how periods of inactivity affect relative skill in order to improve matchmaking for users with periods of inactivity or churn.  \n\n**Questions**: \n\n* _Do users experience mmr decay after periods of inactivity?_  \n* _For users who do,_ \n+ _Is there a relationship between user liftime prior to churn and mmr decay?_\n+ _Is there a relationship between the duration of the user's period of inactivity and mmr decay?_\n\n```{r, message=FALSE, results='hide'} \nsource(\"mmr_decay.R\")\n```\n\n\n```{r fig.width=9, fig.height=4}\ng1 <- ggplot(mmrData2, aes(x = final_mmr_diff)) + \n  geom_histogram(aes(fill = ..count..)) + \n  ggtitle(\"Pre and post churn 5 game average MMR Difference\") \nggplotly(g1)\n\n```\n",
